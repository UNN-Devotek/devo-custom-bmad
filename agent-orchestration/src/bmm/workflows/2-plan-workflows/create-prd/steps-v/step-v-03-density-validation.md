# Step 3: Information Density Validation

## YOUR TASK

Validate PRD meets BMAD information density standards by scanning for conversational filler, wordy phrases, and redundant expressions that violate conciseness principles. This step runs autonomously — no user input needed.

### Step-Specific Rules

- Focus ONLY on information density anti-patterns
- FORBIDDEN to validate other aspects in this step
- FORBIDDEN to pause or request user input — auto-proceed when complete

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Attempt Sub-Process Validation

**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**

"Perform information density validation on this PRD:

1. Load the PRD file
2. Scan for the following anti-patterns:
   - Conversational filler phrases (examples: 'The system will allow users to...', 'It is important to note that...', 'In order to')
   - Wordy phrases (examples: 'Due to the fact that', 'In the event of', 'For the purpose of')
   - Redundant phrases (examples: 'Future plans', 'Absolutely essential', 'Past history')
3. Count violations by category with line numbers
4. Classify severity: Critical (>10 violations), Warning (5-10), Pass (<5)

Return structured findings with counts and examples."

### 2. Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)

If Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:

**Scan for conversational filler patterns:**
- "The system will allow users to..."
- "It is important to note that..."
- "In order to"
- "For the purpose of"
- "With regard to"
- Count occurrences and note line numbers

**Scan for wordy phrases:**
- "Due to the fact that" (use "because")
- "In the event of" (use "if")
- "At this point in time" (use "now")
- "In a manner that" (use "how")
- Count occurrences and note line numbers

**Scan for redundant phrases:**
- "Future plans" (just "plans")
- "Past history" (just "history")
- "Absolutely essential" (just "essential")
- "Completely finish" (just "finish")
- Count occurrences and note line numbers

### 3. Classify Severity

**Calculate total violations:**
- Conversational filler count
- Wordy phrases count
- Redundant phrases count
- Total = sum of all categories

**Determine severity:**
- **Critical:** Total > 10 violations
- **Warning:** Total 5-10 violations
- **Pass:** Total < 5 violations

### 4. Report Density Findings to Validation Report

Append to validation report:

```markdown
## Information Density Validation

**Anti-Pattern Violations:**

**Conversational Filler:** {count} occurrences
[If count > 0, list examples with line numbers]

**Wordy Phrases:** {count} occurrences
[If count > 0, list examples with line numbers]

**Redundant Phrases:** {count} occurrences
[If count > 0, list examples with line numbers]

**Total Violations:** {total}

**Severity Assessment:** [Critical/Warning/Pass]

**Recommendation:**
[If Critical] "PRD requires significant revision to improve information density. Every sentence should carry weight without filler."
[If Warning] "PRD would benefit from reducing wordiness and eliminating filler phrases."
[If Pass] "PRD demonstrates good information density with minimal violations."
```

### 5. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed

Display: "**Information Density Validation Complete**

Severity: {Critical/Warning/Pass}

**Proceeding to next validation check...**"
