# Step 2: Project Understanding

Understand the project context, target users, and what makes this product special from a UX perspective.

## PROJECT DISCOVERY SEQUENCE

### 1. Review Loaded Context

Analyze what we know from the loaded documents:

"Based on the project documentation we have loaded, let me confirm what I'm understanding about {{project_name}}.

**From the documents:**
{summary of key insights from loaded PRD, briefs, and other context documents}

**Target Users:**
{summary of user information from loaded documents}

**Key Features/Goals:**
{summary of main features and goals from loaded documents}

Does this match your understanding? Are there any corrections or additions you'd like to make?"

### 2. Fill Context Gaps (If no documents or gaps exist)

If no documents were loaded or key information is missing:

"Since we don't have complete documentation, let's start with the essentials:

**What are you building?** (Describe your product in 1-2 sentences)

**Who is this for?** (Describe your ideal user or target audience)

**What makes this special or different?** (What's the unique value proposition?)

**What's the main thing users will do with this?** (Core user action or goal)"

### 3. Explore User Context

"Let me understand your users better to inform the UX design:

- What problem are users trying to solve?
- What frustrates them with current solutions?
- What would make them say 'this is exactly what I needed'?
- How tech-savvy are your target users?
- What devices will they use most?
- When/where will they use this product?"

### 4. Identify UX Design Challenges

"From what we've discussed, I'm seeing some key UX design considerations:

**Design Challenges:**
- [Identify 2-3 key UX challenges based on project type and user needs]
- [Note any platform-specific considerations]
- [Highlight any complex user flows or interactions]

**Design Opportunities:**
- [Identify 2-3 areas where great UX could create competitive advantage]
- [Note any opportunities for innovative UX patterns]

Does this capture the key UX considerations we need to address?"

### 5. Generate Project Understanding Content

When saving to document, append these sections:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

[Project vision summary based on conversation]

### Target Users

[Target user descriptions based on conversation]

### Key Design Challenges

[Key UX challenges identified based on conversation]

### Design Opportunities

[Design opportunities identified based on conversation]
```

### 6. Present Content and Menu

"I've documented our understanding of {{project_name}} from a UX perspective. This will guide all our design decisions moving forward.

**Here's what I'll add to the document:**

[Show the complete markdown content from step 5]

**What would you like to do?**
[AR] Adversarial Review [C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to core experience definition"

### 7. Handle Menu Selection

**If AR:** Execute `{project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/review-adversarial-general.xml` — pass the current content as the content to review; display findings with recommendations; then redisplay this menu.

**If C:**
- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2]`
- Load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/create-ux-design/steps/step-03-core-experience.md`
