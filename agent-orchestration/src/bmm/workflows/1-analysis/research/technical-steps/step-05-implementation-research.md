# Technical Research Step 5: Implementation Research

## YOUR TASK:

Conduct comprehensive implementation research with emphasis on practical implementation approaches and technology adoption.

## IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH SEQUENCE:

### 1. Begin Implementation Research

Start with implementation research approach:
"Now I'll complete our technical research with **implementation approaches and technology adoption** analysis.

**Implementation Research Focus:**

- Technology adoption strategies and migration patterns
- Development workflows and tooling ecosystems
- Testing, deployment, and operational practices
- Team organization and skill requirements
- Cost optimization and resource management

**Let me search for current implementation and adoption strategies.**"

### 2. Web Search for Technology Adoption

Search for current adoption strategies:
Search the web: "technology adoption strategies migration"

**Adoption focus:**

- Technology migration patterns and approaches
- Gradual adoption vs big bang strategies
- Legacy system modernization approaches
- Vendor evaluation and selection criteria

### 3. Web Search for Development Workflows

Search for current development practices:
Search the web: "software development workflows tooling"

**Workflow focus:**

- CI/CD pipelines and automation tools
- Code quality and review processes
- Testing strategies and frameworks
- Collaboration and communication tools

### 4. Web Search for Operational Excellence

Search for current operational practices:
Search the web: "DevOps operations best practices"

**Operations focus:**

- Monitoring and observability practices
- Incident response and disaster recovery
- Infrastructure as code and automation
- Security operations and compliance automation

### 5. Generate Implementation Research Content

Prepare implementation analysis with web search citations:

#### Content Structure:

When saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:

```markdown

### 6. Present Analysis and Continue Option

Show the generated implementation research and present continue option:
"I've completed the **implementation research and technology adoption** analysis for {{research_topic}}.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Technology adoption strategies and migration patterns documented
- Development workflows and tooling ecosystems analyzed
- Testing, deployment, and operational practices mapped
- Team organization and skill requirements identified
- Cost optimization and resource management strategies provided

**Ready to proceed to the final synthesis step?**
[AR] Adversarial Review [C] Continue - Save this to document and proceed to synthesis

### 7. Handle Continue Selection

#### If 'AR' (Adversarial Review):

- IF AR: Execute {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/review-adversarial-general.xml — pass the current editPlan (or plan document in context) as the content to review; display findings with recommendations; then redisplay this menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Append the final content to the research document
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Load: `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/research/technical-steps/step-06-research-synthesis.md`

## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:

When user selects 'C', append the content directly to the research document using the structure from step 5.

## NEXT STEP:

After user selects 'C', load `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/research/technical-steps/step-06-research-synthesis.md` to produce the comprehensive technical research document with narrative introduction, detailed TOC, and executive summary.
