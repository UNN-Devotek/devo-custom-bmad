# Track: Small

## Scope

| Criterion     | Threshold                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Files touched | 2-4                                        |
| Complexity    | Single concern, clear acceptance criteria  |
| Examples      | Bug fix with test, small feature addition  |

## Workflow Chain

```
Quick Spec -> Quick Dev -> Review Gate (3-sub) -> QA Tests -> USER APPROVAL -> PTM
```

## Steps

### 1. Quick Spec
- Agent: `arcwright-agent-awm-quick-flow-solo-dev`
- Deployment: in-process (or split pane if user requests visibility)
- Output: concise task definition, acceptance criteria

### 2. Quick Dev
- Agent: `arcwright-agent-awm-quick-flow-solo-dev`
- Deployment: split pane, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- tmux: `tmux split-window -h`
- Context: Quick Spec output

Completion signal:
```
tmux send-keys -t $SPAWNER_PANE "STEP COMPLETE: QD | result: done | session: $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" Enter
```

### 3. Review Gate
- Agent: `review agent`
- Deployment: split pane
- review_type: `3-sub`
- 3 concurrent sub-agents:
  - Sub-1 (architect): AR + DRY -- **1 pass max** (Small override, no retry loop)
  - Sub-2 (ux-designer): UV
  - Sub-3 (security): SR
- Each sub-agent fixes its own findings
- If critical finding persists after 1 pass: escalate to user, do not loop

AR rule for Small: 1 pass only. Overrides general AR max-3 rule.

Completion signal:
```
tmux send-keys -t $SPAWNER_PANE "STEP COMPLETE: REVIEW | result: {pass|escalate} | session: $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" Enter
```

### 4. QA Tests
- Agent: `qa-agent`
- Deployment: split pane
- Method: Load the `playwright-cli` skill. Primary approach: drive tests through the UI programmatically — navigate, interact, assert. `npx playwright test` with `.spec.ts` files is secondary, only when critical path logic (auth, payments, core data flows) is touched.
- Scope: acceptance criteria from Quick Spec

Completion signal:
```
tmux send-keys -t $SPAWNER_PANE "STEP COMPLETE: QA | result: {pass|fail} | session: $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" Enter
```

### 5. USER APPROVAL
Present summary block and wait for explicit `[approve]`:
```
✅ Ready to merge `{branch}`.

Change summary:
  Files: {N}
  DRY: ✅  UV: ✅  SR: ✅
  QA:  ✅ passed

[approve] Proceed to /prepare-to-merge
[review]  I want to check something first
```

Wait for explicit `[approve]` before running PTM. Do NOT auto-proceed.

### 6. PTM
- `/prepare-to-merge` in-process

## Non-tmux Variant

**Claude Code:** Mode [1] sequential steps in same conversation. Mode [2] command blocks for dev and QA steps.

**Kiro CLI:** Use the `subagent` tool to run the pipeline:
```json
{
  "task": "Small track: [task description]",
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "spec",
      "role": "arcwright-quick-flow-solo-dev",
      "prompt_template": "Write a quick spec for: {task}. Output: task definition + acceptance criteria."
    },
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "role": "arcwright-dev",
      "prompt_template": "Implement per spec: {task}",
      "depends_on": ["spec"]
    },
    {
      "name": "review",
      "role": "arcwright-review-orchestrator",
      "prompt_template": "3-sub review (AR+DRY, UV, SR) of implementation for: {task}",
      "depends_on": ["dev"]
    },
    {
      "name": "qa",
      "role": "arcwright-qa",
      "prompt_template": "QA validation for: {task}. Use playwright-cli for UI, assertions for logic.",
      "depends_on": ["review"]
    }
  ]
}
```
