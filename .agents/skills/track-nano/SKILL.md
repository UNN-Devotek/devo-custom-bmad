# Track: Nano

## Scope

| Criterion       | Threshold                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Files touched   | 1-2                                |
| Lines changed   | <=20                               |
| New imports     | None                               |
| Undo complexity | One-commit revert                  |
| Examples        | Typo fix, label change, single CSS tweak |

If scope exceeds 20 lines OR requires new imports during dev -> upgrade to Small.

## Workflow Chain

```
Quick Dev (split pane) -> DRY+UV Gate (in-process) -> USER APPROVAL -> PTM
```

## Steps

### 1. Quick Dev
- Agent: `arcwright-agent-awm-quick-flow-solo-dev`
- Deployment: split pane, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- tmux: `tmux split-window -h`
- Scope check: if changes exceed threshold, agent signals upgrade and halts.

Completion signal (agent sends to spawner):
```
tmux send-keys -t $SPAWNER_PANE "STEP COMPLETE: QD | result: done | session: $CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" Enter
```

### 2. DRY+UV Gate
- Agent: `review agent`, in-process
- review_type: `2-sub-spec`
- Sub-1 (architect): DRY only -- no AR at this scale
- Sub-2 (ux-designer): UV -- auto-pass for pure backend changes
- Each sub-agent fixes its own findings inline

### 3. USER APPROVAL
Present summary block and wait for [approve]:
```
✅ DRY+UV gate passed. Ready to merge `{branch}`.

Change summary:
  Files: {N} ({lines} lines changed)
  DRY: ✅ passed ({N} 🟡 auto-fixed)
  UV:  ✅ passed

[approve] Proceed to /prepare-to-merge
[review]  I want to check something first
```

Wait for explicit `[approve]` before running PTM. Do NOT auto-proceed.

### 4. PTM
- `/prepare-to-merge` in-process

## Skipped Stages

| Stage        | Reason                               |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| AR           | Overhead exceeds value at this scale |
| SR           | Auto-pass                            |
| QA spec file | Inline assertions only               |

Exception: if critical path is touched (auth, payments), add inline assertions and escalate to Small.

## QA Note

Load the `playwright-cli` skill if any UI is touched. Verify the change works through the UI programmatically — navigate to the affected element and assert the expected behaviour. No `.spec.ts` file required unless the change touches critical path logic (auth, payments, core data flows).

## Non-tmux Variant

**Claude Code:** Mode [1] same-conversation for both Quick Dev and DRY+UV gate steps sequentially.

**Kiro CLI:** Use the `subagent` tool to run the pipeline:
```json
{
  "task": "Nano track: [task description]",
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "role": "arcwright-quick-flow-solo-dev",
      "prompt_template": "Implement: {task}. Scope: 1-2 files, <=20 lines. If scope exceeds, signal upgrade to Small."
    },
    {
      "name": "dry-uv-gate",
      "role": "arcwright-review-orchestrator",
      "prompt_template": "DRY+UV review of changes for: {task}. DRY only (no AR at nano scale). UV auto-pass for pure backend.",
      "depends_on": ["dev"]
    }
  ]
}
```
