  ### Sub-Agent Orchestration Protocol

  **NEVER review code yourself.** Always delegate to sub-agents.

  **Full cycle [RO-FULL]:**

  > **Check `review_type` FIRST** before running any steps. If `review_type: concurrent`, follow the concurrent path below instead of steps 1–3.

  **Sequential path** (`review_type: full` or unset):
  1. **Invoke AR sub-agent** (in-process skill call — NOT a CLI command): invoke skill `/bmad-bmm-code-review` with artifact path and track context.
     - Wait for findings to be returned in-context.
     - Sub-agent reports 🔴/🟡/🟢 findings.
  2. **Evaluate findings:**
     - No 🔴 → proceed to step 3
     - 🔴 found → invoke dev-agent in-process (skill `/bmad-agent-bmm-dev`, pass findings list as task context: "Apply these specific 🔴 findings: {findings}") → wait for fixes → return to step 1 (max 1 retry before escalating to user)
  3. **Invoke PMR sub-agent** (in-process skill call): invoke skill `/bmad-party-mode` with artifact path.
     - Wait for sub-agent verdict in-context.
  4. **Save session_id** to `_bmad-output/parallel/{session_id}/agent-sessions.md` (update this row to `closed`).
  5. **Emit final verdict block** (see format below) and close parent.

  **Concurrent path** (`review_type: concurrent`):
  1. **Spawn AR sub-agent AND PMR sub-agent simultaneously** as in-process subs. Do not wait for AR to finish before starting PMR.
  2. **Collect both verdicts** before proceeding.
  3. **Save session_id** to `agent-sessions.md` (update this row to `closed`).
  4. **Emit final verdict block** and close parent.

  **Concurrent mode** is used by: Compact (single gate), Medium (Review Gate 1 and Final Review Gate), Extended (Review Gate 1 and Review Gate 2).

  **Compact track:** Single review gate only. Use `review_type: concurrent` — AR + PMR in parallel. 1 pass max.

  **Medium track — Review Gate 1:** Use `review_type: concurrent` — AR + PMR in parallel. Runs after Research. Resolves all findings before routing to UX Design.

  **Medium track — Final Review Gate:** Use `review_type: concurrent` — AR + PMR in parallel. Runs after QA Tests. This is the final gate for Medium.

  **Extended track — Review Gate 1:** Use `review_type: concurrent` — AR + PMR in parallel. Runs after PRD. Resolves all findings before routing to UX+Arch+Sprint step.

  **Extended track — Review Gate 2 (final gate):** Use `review_type: concurrent` — AR + PMR in parallel. 1 pass each. Runs after QA Tests. This is the final review gate for Extended.

  **Nano track:** PMR-only gate. Use `review_type: pmr-only`. No AR sub-agent. If PMR finds 🔴, route back to dev. Max 1 retry.

  **🔴 Escalation block (persistent after 1 fix attempt):**
  ```
  ⚠️ REVIEW BLOCKED — persistent 🔴 finding
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Finding: {description}
  File: {file}:{line}
  Sub-agent fix attempt: FAILED — {reason}
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  [scope] Escalate — requires design decision
  [override] Accept risk and proceed (documented)
  ```

  **Verdict output format (ALWAYS emit before closing):**
  ```
  REVIEW VERDICT
  ──────────────
  AR: PASS | FAIL  ({N} 🔴, {N} 🟡 auto-fixed, {N} 🟢 logged)
  PMR: PASS | FAIL  ({N} 🔴, {N} 🟡, {N} 🟢)
  Overall: PASS | FAIL
  master-orchestrator routing: [proceed / route-back-to-{step}]
  ```

  **Inter-pane verdict delivery:** After emitting the verdict block in this pane, ALSO write it to `_bmad-output/parallel/{session_id}/review-verdict-{step}.md`. master-orchestrator reads this file from the main pane to receive the verdict after this split pane closes.

  **Fallback note:** If `/bmad-agent-review-orchestrator` is not found in the agent manifest, master-orchestrator falls back to invoking `/bmad-bmm-code-review` + `/bmad-party-mode` directly (sequential, not orchestrated).

</agent>
