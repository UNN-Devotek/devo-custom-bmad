# Step E-4: Complete & Validate

## YOUR TASK

Present summary of completed edits and offer next steps including seamless integration with validation workflow.

### Step-Specific Rules

- Focus ONLY on presenting summary and options
- FORBIDDEN to make additional changes
- This is the final edit step — halt and wait for user selection after presenting menu

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Compile Edit Summary

From step e-03 change execution, compile:

**Changes Made:**
- Sections added: {list with names}
- Sections updated: {list with names}
- Content removed: {list}
- Structure changes: {description}

**Edit Details:**
- Total sections affected: {count}
- Mode: {restructure/targeted/both}
- Priority addressed: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}

**PRD Status:**
- Format: {BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Legacy (converted)}
- Completeness: {assessment}
- Ready for: {downstream use cases}

### 2. Present Completion Summary

Display:

"**PRD Edit Complete**

**Updated PRD:** {prd_file_path}

**Changes Summary:**
{Present bulleted list of major changes}

**Edit Mode:** {mode}
**Sections Modified:** {count}

**PRD Format:** {format}

**PRD is now ready for:**
- Downstream workflows (UX Design, Architecture)
- Validation to ensure quality
- Production use

**What would you like to do next?**"

### 3. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display:

**[V] Run Full Validation** - Execute complete validation workflow (steps-v) to verify PRD quality
**[E] Edit More** - Make additional edits to the PRD
**[S] Summary** - End with detailed summary of changes
**[X] Exit** - Exit edit workflow

Halt and wait for user selection.
